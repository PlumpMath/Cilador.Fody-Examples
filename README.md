##Welcome to the Cilador.Fody-Examples project!

The purpose of this project is to provide examples showing
how to use [Cilador.Fody](http://github.com/rileywhite/Cilador).
It may be a bit sparse, but that's by design. After all,
the purpose of an example is to be easy to follow, right?

Please note that, unlike Cilador.Fody which is available
under the commercial friendly Apache License, this project
is ["unlicensed"](http://unlicense.org/); it is intended to be
public domain. Feel free to use it as a starting point for any
project of your own, open source or closed, for freeware,
shareware, payware, or corporate use. Just remember that once
you take a copy, it becomes yours to love and support for as long
as you see fit.
