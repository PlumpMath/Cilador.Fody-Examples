_(Note: Bix.Mixers.Fody is currently in the process of its initial release. Until the release is complete and the NuGet package is available, this example will not be usable.)_

##Welcome to the Bix.Mixers.Fody-Examples project!

The purpose of this project is to provide examples showing
how to use [Bix.Mixers.Fody](http://github.com/rileywhite/Bix.Mixers.Fody).
It may be a bit sparse now, but that's by design. After all,
the purpose of an example is to be easy to follow, right?

But seriously, I do recognize that one example does not
necessitate a plural name. I expect this'll grow, and I don't
want to have to change the name if and when it does :-)
